«Моццарелла» - это воплощение идеи, зародившейся ещё в Европе...\r\n                    Три человека - Луиджи, Сигфрид и Гаэтано - объединились вместе для осуществления общей мечты – поделиться вкусом традиционных итальянских и в целом средиземноморских блюд, а главное, своей любовью к кулинарии с местными гурманами.\r\n                    Они встретились и познакомились только в Челябинске. В разговоре Гаэтано упоминает о своей идее открыть небольшое заведение с возможностью готовить по традиционным итальянским рецептам на глазах у гостей. На этой фразе между ними вспыхивает искра, так как Луиджи, прежде чем переехать в Челябинск, работал в пиццерии недалеко от Милана, где зародилась его страсть к работе с тестом. Ему повезло учиться у чемпиона мира 2011 г. по приготовлению неаполитанской пиццы. Неаполитанская пицца отличается от пиццы других регионов. Таким образом, Луиджи, работая в пиццерии и ежедневно совершенствуясь, становится шеф-пиццайоло.\r\n                    Сигфрид в юности работал в разных ресторанах Испании, чтобы оплатить обучение. Оттуда берет начало его любовь к кулинарии. Как только он возвращается в свою любимую Францию, благодаря помощи одного друга семьи он берёт в управление бистро. Сигфрид работает там 3 года и уже тогда мечтает о собственном заведении. По работе Сигфрид оказывается в Челябинске.\r\n                    Однажды в компании друзей Гаэтано и Луиджи вдохновенно обсуждали идею создания пиццерии–траттории под семейным управлением. Сигфрид включился в разговор и решил во что бы то ни стало стать частью этой МЕЧТЫ, которая стала РЕАЛЬНОСТЬЮ.\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n            <h2
